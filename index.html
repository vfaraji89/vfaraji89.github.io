            Work on product with <span class="turquoise">Applied AI</span> — building fast prototypes, automation flows, and learning agent-based systems that turn raw human and user data into products people actually use. My motto is to build more, to contribute max and less verbose.

        <h2 class="section-title">Focus</h2>
        <p>
            My focus is on organizing messy data into taxonomies, extracting insights from unstructured signals, and shaping patterns into scalable systems. I like to get granular — digging into the small details.

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Toolkit</h2>
        <p>
            My toolkit spans SQL for data management, Python for automation and analysis, and AI frameworks and workflow automation platforms. I’m also learning vector databases and Docker to better understand how to scale in production.
